# You can use the `pandas` library in Python to read the CSV file, calculate the differences, and then save the result back to the CSV file. Here's an example of how you can do it:

# ```python
import pandas as pd

# Read the CSV file into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('your_file.csv')

# Calculate the differences
df['Difference'] = df['Column1'].diff()

# Save the result back to the CSV file
df.to_csv('your_file.csv', index=False)
# ```

# This code assumes that the column with the values you mentioned is named 'Column1' in the CSV file. If the column has a different name, you need to replace 'Column1' with the actual column name in your file.

# Note that this code will create a new column named 'Difference' containing the differences between consecutive values. If you want to overwrite the original column instead, you can replace `df['Difference'] = df['Column1'].diff()` with `df['Column1'] = df['Column1'].diff()`.
