# You can use the `bisect` module in Python to achieve this. The `bisect.bisect` function can be used to find the index in a sorted list where a given value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order. In your case, you can use it to find the index where the threshold value should be inserted, which will be the index of the first value above the threshold.

# Here is the updated code:

# ```python
import bisect

demo_list = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 8, 13]
threshold = 4

index = bisect.bisect(demo_list, threshold)
print(index)  # Output: 3
print(demo_list[index])  # Output: 5
# ```

# By using `bisect.bisect`, you can directly get the index of the first value above the threshold without looping through the list and checking each item.
