# The code you provided seems to be aiming at scraping a free proxy website, extracting the IP addresses and ports, and then saving them into a CSV file.

# Here are a few suggestions to improve and optimize the code:

# 1. Instead of using the `lxml` parser in BeautifulSoup, you can use the default parser (`html.parser`) which is usually sufficient for most cases.

# 2. Instead of manually converting the BeautifulSoup objects to strings and manipulating them, you can directly extract the text from the elements using the `get_text()` method.

# 3. Use list comprehensions to simplify and condense the code. For example, instead of using multiple for loops, you can use a single list comprehension to extract the required data from the elements.

# 4. Use the `zip()` function to combine the IP addresses and ports into tuples.

# 5. It's good practice to handle exceptions when making HTTP requests or parsing the HTML to prevent the code from crashing. You can use try-except blocks for error handling.

# 6. Use the `with` statement when dealing with file operations to ensure proper handling of resources.

# Here's an updated version of your code incorporating these suggestions:

# ```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import csv

url = 'https://free-proxy-list.net/'

try:
    page = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(page.content, 'html.parser')

    # Find the table header elements
    headers = [header.get_text() for header in soup.find_all('th')]
    headers = headers[:2] + headers[6:]

    # Find the IP addresses and ports
    ips = [ip.get_text() for ip in soup.find_all('td')[::8]]
    ports = [port.get_text() for port in soup.find_all('td')[1::8]]
    ports = ports[:len(ips)]  # Make sure the number of ports matches IPs

    # Combine the IP addresses and ports into tuples
    proxies = list(zip(ips, ports))

    # Save proxies to a CSV file
    with open('ips.csv', 'w', newline='') as csv_file:
        writer = csv.writer(csv_file)
        writer.writerow(headers)
        writer.writerows(proxies)

    # Print the saved proxies
    for proxy in proxies:
        print(proxy)

except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
# ```

# These changes should make the code more concise, readable, and easier to maintain. Additionally, error handling has been added to handle potential exceptions during the scraping process.
