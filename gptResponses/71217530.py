# You can use the `bitcoinlib` library in Python to generate your SOL address using the mnemonic seed phrase and the desired derivation path. Here's how you can do it:

# 1. Install the `bitcoinlib` library using pip:
# ```
# pip install bitcoinlib
# ```

# 2. Import the necessary modules:
# ```python
from bitcoinlib import HDWallet
# ```

# 3. Define your mnemonic seed phrase:
# ```python
mnemonic = "your mnemonic seed phrase goes here"
# ```

# 4. Initialize an HD wallet object with the mnemonic seed:
# ```python
wallet = HDWallet().from_mnemonic(mnemonic)
# ```

# 5. Derive the SOL address from the HD wallet using the specified derivation path:
# ```python
derivation_path = "m/44'/501'/0'/0"
sol_address = wallet.get_child_for_path(derivation_path).address()
# ```

# Now, the `sol_address` variable will contain your generated SOL address.

# It is important to note that the above code assumes you have the `bitcoinlib` library installed and have defined the `mnemonic` variable with your actual mnemonic seed phrase. Also, make sure to handle your mnemonic seed phrase securely as it gives access to your funds.
