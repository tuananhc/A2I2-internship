# To add the budget column in the list, you can use a `for` loop to iterate over the list and sum up the budget values. Here's an example of how you can do it using the `+=` operator:

# ```python
def total_budget():
    film_list = get_records()
    total = 0
    for film in film_list:
        total += film[2]  # film[2] represents the budget column
    return total
# ```

# In this example, `total` is initialized as 0 before the loop. Then, for each `film` in the `film_list`, the budget value (`film[2]`) is added to the `total`. Finally, the `total` value is returned.

# You can then call the `total_budget()` function to get the sum of the budget column:

# ```python
# print(total_budget())  # Output: 480
# ```

# The output will be `480`, which is the sum of the budget values in the list.
