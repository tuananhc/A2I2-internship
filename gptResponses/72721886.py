# Your approach seems to be on the right track. You are simulating a POST request with the necessary form data to retrieve the dynamically loaded HTML table from the server. However, there are a few adjustments and considerations to keep in mind:

# 1. Make sure the `payload` dictionary contains all the required form data parameters. You have correctly included some of them (`__VIEWSTATE`, `__VIEWSTATEGENERATOR`, `__EVENTVALIDATION`, etc.), but make sure you include all the necessary fields and values. You can view these in the form data of the network request in the Developer Tools.

# 2. The `data` parameter in the `session.post()` method should be used instead of the `params` parameter. The `data` parameter is used for sending form data in a POST request, while the `params` parameter is used for sending query parameters in a GET request.

# 3. Ensure that the `headers` dictionary includes the necessary headers for the request. It seems like you have included the `User-Agent` header, but there might be other headers required for successful communication with the server. You can inspect the headers in the network request in the Developer Tools.

# 4. Consider using the BeautifulSoup library (bs4) to parse the response HTML and extract the desired information from the table. You can pass the `res.text` to a BeautifulSoup object and use its methods to navigate and extract the required data.

# Here's an example with the adjustments mentioned above:

# ```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Create a requests session
session = requests.Session()

url = "https://azbomprod.azmd.gov/GLSuiteWeb/Clients/AZBOM/public/WebVerificationSearch.aspx?q=azmd&t=20220622123512"

# Set the necessary headers
headers = {
    'User-Agent': 'My-Agent-Placeholder',
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
}

# Make a GET request to retrieve the required form data
res = session.get(url, headers=headers)
soup = BeautifulSoup(res.text, 'html.parser')

# Extract the form data from the response HTML
payload = {
    "__VIEWSTATE": soup.select_one('#__VIEWSTATE')['value'],
    "__VIEWSTATEGENERATOR": soup.select_one('#__VIEWSTATEGENERATOR')['value'],
    "__EVENTVALIDATION": soup.select_one('#__EVENTVALIDATION')['value'],
    "ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$Name": 'rbName1',  # Adjust the required form values accordingly
    "ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$txtLastName": '',
    "ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$txtFirstName": '',
    "ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$License": 'rbLicense1',
    "ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$txtLicNum": '',
    "ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$Specialty": 'rbSpecialty1',
    "ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$ddlSpecialty": '12155',
    "ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$ddlCounty": '15910',
    "ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$txtCity": '',
    "__EVENTTARGET": "ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$btnSpecial",
    "__EVENTARGUMENT": ''
}

# Make the POST request with the form data
res = session.post(url, data=payload, headers=headers)

# Parse the response HTML with BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(res.text, 'html.parser')

# Extract the desired data from the table
table = soup.find('table')
# Process the table data further as per your requirements

print(res.text)  # Optionally, check the HTML response for verification
# ```

# Make sure to adjust the form values and data according to your specific requirements. Additionally, inspect the response HTML to verify if any additional form fields, parameters, or headers need to be included in the request.
