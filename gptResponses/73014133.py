# Your code is very close, but there are a couple of syntax errors. When appending items to `sofit`, you need to enclose the items in parentheses instead of using a comma. Additionally, when appending the reversed tuples, you need to enclose them in parentheses as well. Here's the corrected code:

# ```python
def mult_tuple(tuple1, tuple2):
    sofit = []
    for x in tuple1:
        for y in tuple2:
            sofit.append((x, y))
            sofit.append((y, x))
    return tuple(sofit)
# ```

# Now, you can test the function:

# ```python
first_tuple = (1, 2)
second_tuple = (4, 5)
print(mult_tuple(first_tuple, second_tuple))
# ```

# Output:
# ```
# ((1, 4), (4, 1), (1, 5), (5, 1), (2, 4), (4, 2), (2, 5), (5, 2))
# ```

# This should give you the desired result.
