# In Python, you can use the `threading.Event` class to implement a similar behavior to the JavaScript code you provided. However, there are a couple of modifications you need to make.

# Here's the modified Python code that achieves the desired behavior:

# ```python
import threading
import time

class MyEventThread(threading.Thread):
    def __init__(self):
        threading.Thread.__init__(self)
        self.event = threading.Event()
        self.x = 0

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.event.wait()
            if self.event.is_set():
                print("Event is set:", self.x)
                self.x += 1
            self.event.clear()
            time.sleep(0.3)

event_thread = MyEventThread()
event_thread.start()

while True:
    event_thread.event.set()
    time.sleep(1)
# ```

# In this code, we define a custom `MyEventThread` class that extends `threading.Thread`. We override the `run` method to contain the logic you want to execute when the event is called.

# Within the `run` method, we use `self.event.wait()` to block the execution until the event is set. Once the event is set, the corresponding code is executed, and then we clear the event using `self.event.clear()` before sleeping for a short period of time.

# In the main part of the code, we create an instance of the `MyEventThread` class and start it using `event_thread.start()`. Then, in the main loop, we continuously set the event using `event_thread.event.set()` and sleep for 1 second between each event.

# This way, the `myFunction` function will run each time the event is called.
