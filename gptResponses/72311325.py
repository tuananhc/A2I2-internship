# Sure, I can help you with that. In Ursina Engine, you can create a pause menu by using a combination of input handling and scene switching.

# First, you need to create a separate scene for your pause menu. Here's an example of how you can structure it:

# ```python
from ursina import *

def update():
    if held_keys['escape']:
        application.quit()

class GameMenu(Entity):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

        self.background = Entity(model='quad', scale=(2,1), texture='pause_menu_bg', parent=self)

        resume_button = Button(text='Resume', scale=(0.15, 0.05), parent=self)
        resume_button.on_click = self.resume_game

        quit_button = Button(text='Quit', scale=(0.15, 0.05), parent=self)
        quit_button.on_click = self.quit_game

    def resume_game(self):
        # Switch back to the main game scene
        destroy(self)

    def quit_game(self):
        application.quit()


def start_game():
    # Initialize your game scene
    game = Entity(model='cube', scale=2)
    return game

def pause():
    # Pause the game by activating the pause menu scene
    game_menu = GameMenu()

app = Ursina()
game_scene = start_game()

app.run()
# ```

# In this example, the `GameMenu` class represents your pause menu. It has a background entity and buttons for resume and quit functions. The `resume_game` method is responsible for switching back to the main game scene and the `quit_game` method will close the application.

# The `start_game` function initializes your main game scene. In the `pause` function, you simply need to create an instance of your `GameMenu` class to activate the pause menu.

# You can activate the pause menu by calling the `pause()` function whenever the player triggers the pause action in your game. For example, you can bind the pause action to the Escape key like this:

# ```python
from ursina import *

def input(key):
    if key == 'escape':
        pause()

# Rest of your game code...
# ```

# Make sure to replace the placeholder model, texture, and button logic with your own assets and functionalities.

# I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
