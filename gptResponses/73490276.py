# You can drop the rows where the time is 9:15 by using the following code:

# ```python
df = df[~df['Date'].dt.time.astype(str).str.contains('09:15')]
# ```

# This code will drop the rows where the time in the 'Date' column is 9:15. The "~" symbol negates the condition, so rows with time 9:15 will be dropped from the DataFrame.
