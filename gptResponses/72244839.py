# To achieve the desired behavior of stopping the function after one minute, you can use the `signal` module in Python to set a timeout. Here's an example of how to modify your code to include a timeout:

# ```python
import signal

def foo(txt):
    best_value = -1
    signal.alarm(60)  # Set the timeout to 1 minute

    def timeout_handler(signum, frame):
        raise TimeoutError("Function timed out")

    signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, timeout_handler)

    try:
        for word in txt:
            if value(word) > best_value:
                best_value = value(word)
    except TimeoutError:
        pass

    signal.alarm(0)  # Cancel the timeout
    return best_value
# ```

# The `signal.alarm(60)` line sets the timeout to 1 minute. Then, the `timeout_handler` function is defined as a signal handler that raises a `TimeoutError` exception when called. This handler is associated with the `SIGALRM` signal using `signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, timeout_handler)`.

# Inside the `try` block, the function will execute as usual. If the function takes longer than one minute to complete, the `TimeoutError` exception will be caught in the `except` block, and the function will return the best value found so far.

# The `signal.alarm(0)` line cancels the previously set timeout so that it doesn't affect subsequent code execution.
