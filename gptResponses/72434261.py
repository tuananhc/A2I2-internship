# Certainly! Here's the equivalent Python code for the curl command you provided:

# ```python
import requests

url = 'https://192.168.16.220:9000/api/views/search/messages'
headers = {
    'X-Requested-By': 'superman',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Accept': 'text/csv'
}
data = {
    "streams": [
        "62948e1fcd664d57cccfa29c"
    ],
    "query_string": {
        "type": "elasticsearch",
        "query_string": "source"
    },
    "timerange": {
        "type": "relative",
        "range": 30
    }
}
auth = ('admin', 'admin')

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data, auth=auth, verify=False)
print(response.text)
# ```

# In this Python code, we're using the `requests` library to send a POST request to the specified URL. The headers, data, authentication, and SSL verification options are set accordingly. Finally, the response of the request is printed.

# Note: The `-k` option in curl (`--insecure`) is used to disable SSL verification. In the Python code, we set `verify=False` to achieve the same behavior. However, it is generally recommended to verify SSL certificates for security purposes.
