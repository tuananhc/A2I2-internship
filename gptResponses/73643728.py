To automate the versioning process in Poetry and include additional information such as the date, Jira task number, or Git branch name, you can use a combination of Poetry and custom scripts or tools.

Here's a suggested approach:

1. Generate a standard version using Poetry:
   Create a version file (let's call it `version.txt`) in your project's root directory and specify the version number in it, like `0.1.1a0`. Update this file whenever you want to change the version.

2. Use a script or tool to generate a unique version identifier:
   Write a script or use a tool that can generate a unique identifier based on the desired information, such as the date, Jira task number, or Git branch name.

   For example, using Python, you can create a script to append the current date to the version:

   ```python
   import datetime

   # Read the version from the version file
   with open('version.txt', 'r') as f:
       version = f.read().strip()

   # Append the current date to the version
   timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d')  # Format the date as desired
   version_with_date = f'{version}+{timestamp}'

   # Write the updated version to the version file
   with open('version.txt', 'w') as f:
       f.write(version_with_date)
   ```

   Customize the script based on your specific requirements, such as extracting the Jira task number from the branch name or using Git commands to obtain the branch name.

3. Integrate the script into your CI/CD pipeline:
   Set up your CI/CD pipeline to execute the script after merging the feature branch into the develop branch. The script should update the version file with the unique identifier generated in the previous step.

   If you're using popular CI/CD platforms like CircleCI, GitLab CI/CD, or Jenkins, you can add a custom step or job to execute the script. Alternatively, you can run the script manually after merging the feature branch.

By following this approach, you can update your project's version automatically with the desired information, allowing you to differentiate between different feature branches and track their progress.
