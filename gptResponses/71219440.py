# Certainly! To find the sum of seven natural numbers, you can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

# Sum = (n/2)(first term + last term)

# In this case, the first term is 1 and the last term is 7. Therefore, the sum of 7 natural numbers would be:

# Sum = (7/2)(1 + 7) = (7/2)(8) = 28.

# So, the sum of the first 7 natural numbers is 28.
