Here are some examples of unit test cases for the 'myFunc' function based on the given code:

```python
import unittest

class MyFuncTestCase(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_get_request(self):
        # TODO: Test that a GET request is made and the response is returned
        pass

    def test_post_request(self):
        # TODO: Test that a POST request is made with the correct payload and headers
        pass

    def test_response_text(self):
        # TODO: Test that the response text contains the expected data
        pass

    def test_data_extraction(self):
        # TODO: Test that the data is extracted and parsed correctly from the response text
        pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

You can fill in the TODO sections of each test case with the necessary assertions and test logic based on the behavior of the 'myFunc' function.
